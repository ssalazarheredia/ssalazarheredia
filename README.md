### Hello

<!--
**ssalazarheredia/ssalazarheredia** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

### Here are some ideas to get you started:
- ðŸ’¬I'm creative thinker, problem solver and believer in the power of story telling.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a couple of personal projects analysing public vehicle data to explore the shift to electric cars and the effect of public policies in public behaviour.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing in learning more about data story telling, I want to become an expert on telling stories with data.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with any feedback on my projects, just tell me what you think! I belive in continous improvement.
